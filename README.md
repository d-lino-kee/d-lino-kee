## Hi 🤝 My name is **Lino**

I am a student at the University of Waterloo studying Management Engineering. I’m passionate about project management, product management, data analysis, and software engineering, and I’m eager to dive deeper into AI/ML.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- 🥾 Hiking  
- 🏃 Running  
- 🎸 Playing guitar  
- 🎧 Listening to podcasts & music  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Spending time with friends & family  

I’ve worked on projects involving automation, front-end development, and back-end development using Python, JavaScript, and more. I’ve used Python for NLP, Computer Vision, and data analysis (NumPy, Pandas), and JavaScript to build full-stack apps with React.js and Node.js. I’m continually enhancing my proficiency in software development, product management, and AI/ML.
